                                The Internet has transformed our lives in many good ways. Unfortunately, this vast network and its associated technologies also have brought in their wake, the increasing number of security threats. The most effective way to protect yourself from these threats and attacks is to be aware of standard cybersecurity practices.

                        <h3>What is Computer Security?</h3>
                        <p>Computer security is the protection of computer systems and information from harm, theft, and unauthorized use. It is the process of preventing and detecting unauthorized use of your computer system. There are various types of computer security which is widely used to protect the valuable information of an organization or your personal identity.</p>

                    <li><em>Information Security</em> is securing information from unauthorized access, modification & deletion</li>
                    <li><em>Application Security</em> is securing an application by building security features to prevent from Cyber Threats such as SQL injection, DoS attacks, data breaches and etc.</li>
                    <li><em>Computer Security</em> means securing a standalone machine by keeping it updated and patched</li>
                    <li><em>Cyber Security</em> is defined as protecting computer systems, which communicate over the computer networks</li>
                    <li><em>Network Security</em> is by securing both the software and hardware technologies</li>

                <p>Computer security threats are possible dangers that can possibly hamper the normal functioning of your computer. In the present age, cyber threats are constantly increasing as the world is going digital. The most harmful types of computer security are:</p>

            </div>

            <div class="container">
            
                <h4>Viruses</h4>
                <img src="">
                <p>A computer virus is a malicious program which is loaded into the user's computer without user's knowledge. It replicates itself and infects the files and programs on the user's PC. The ultimate goal of a virus is to ensure that the victim's computer will never be able to operate properly or even at all. </p>

                <h4>Computer Worm</h4>
                <img src="">
                <p>A computer worm is a software program that can copy itself from one computer to another, without human interaction. The potential risk here is that it will use up your computer hard disk space because a worm can replicate in greate volume and with great speed.</p>

                <h4>Phishing</h4>
                <img src="">
                <p>Disguising as a trustworthy person or business, phishers attempt to steal sensitive financial or personal information through fraudulent email or instant messages. Phishing in unfortunately very easy to execute. You are deluded into thinking it's the legitimate mail and you may enter your personal information.</p>

                <h4>Keylogger</h4>
                <img src="">
                <p>Keyloggers can track the real-time activity of a user on his computer. It keeps a record of all the keystrokes made by user keyboard. Keylogger is also a very powerful threat to steal people's login credential such as username and password.</p>

                </div>
                <p>These are some of the most common security threats that you'll come across. Fortunately, there are many ways to protect yourself from these attacks.</p>

            <div class="intro">
                <h3>Why is Computer Security so Important?</h3>
                <p>In this digital era, we all need to keep our computers and our personal information secure. Hence computer security is important in order to keep our personal information protected. It is also important to maintain our computer security and its overall health by preventing viruses and malware which would impact on the system performance.</p>
